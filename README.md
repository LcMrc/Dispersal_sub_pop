# Dispersal_sub_pop

Matlab implementation of the code described in: "[Quantifying the impact of dispersal on mutation fixation in subdivided populations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.29.569213v1.abstract)" by Loïc Marrec.

Archived version: TBA

My code simulates the evolutionary dynamics of a population subdivided as the island or the stepping stone model and computes the fixation probability and the fixation time of a mutation.

In order to use the code, please run "generate_and_plot_data.m" under Matlab.
