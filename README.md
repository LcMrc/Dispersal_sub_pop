# Evolutionary Dynamics in Subdivided Populations

This repository contains code and notebooks to simulate **the evolutionary dynamics of subdividied populations** using a Gillespie algorithm and to compute the **fixation probability)**, **the mean number of local fixations**, **the mean number of dispersal events**, and **the fixation time**.

This repository accompanies the following paper:
> **L. Marrec**, *Impact of genotype-dependent dispersal on mutation fixation in subdivided populations*, *Journal of Evolutionary Biology*, in press (2025).  
> BioRxiv preprint: [doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.29.569213](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.29.569213)

## Repository Structure

My code simulates the evolutionary dynamics of a population subdivided as the island or the stepping stone model and computes the fixation probability and the fixation time of a mutation.

In order to use the code, please run "generate_and_plot_data.m" under Matlab.
